# Applied-ML-Research

## Overview
This repository provides a high-level overview of my research internship at Oklahoma State University. During this internship, I worked on machine learning pipelines for classification and regression tasks and prepared datasets for neural network training.

## Key Contributions
- Built ML pipelines in scikit-learn achieving 95% classification accuracy and R² ≈ 0.97 for regression.
- Automated dataset preprocessing using Python and Pandas for over 1,000 entries.
- Processed YOLO object detection datasets using OpenCV by cropping labeled bounding boxes to support model evaluation and analysis.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook
- Neural Networks (architecture overview only)

## Notes
Due to confidentiality agreements, actual code and datasets are not included. This repository highlights skills in ML pipeline development, data preprocessing, and computer vision tasks.
